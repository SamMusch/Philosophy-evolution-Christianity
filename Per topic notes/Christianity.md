### General

2 types of arguments

- Theoretical - Begin with alleged moral facts, then argue that God provides a better explanation of them than secular accounts can offer
- Practical - Begin with claims about some good or end that morality requires and argue that this end is not attainable unless God exists

Objective of Christian arguments: Provide valid arguments with the conclusion that God exists. The premises should be more believable than their denials. Getting "proof" is an extremely high bar that can very rarely be met in philosphy. We look at "evidence" in the sense that it increases the probability of the plausibility that God exists.



Who has the burden of proof?

- (Atheist) Antony Flew - Christians have the burden
- (Christian) Alvin Plantinga (Classical Foundationalism) - There are 2 types of beliefs, God falls into the *basic belief* category
  - Basic beliefs - Self evident, fundamental truth
  - Non-basic beliefs - Needs to be supported by other arguments
- (Christians) We aren't arguing whether God exists, we are arguing about the character of the universe. The whole debate of the "burden of proof" doesn't make sense because both sides are making a claim of the nature of the universe. Christians argue that every object in the world depends ultimately on God, atheists argue that the basic entities of the world exist on their own.



### History of Moral Arguments

#### Thomas Aquinas (1200's)

Among "good" people, we have some kind of "grading" scale. This implies that there is something that is at the "maximum" grade. This is similar to Plato's *forms*, not really taken too seriously anymore.



#### Kant 

(Divine Command) - A rational, moral being must will "the highest good". This consists of:

- A world where people are **moral** and **happy**
- A world where moral virtue is the condition for happiness
  - The only way to believe this is if you believe in the causal structure of moral actions leading to happiness. This would not make sense if there was no God



#### Baggett and Walls (2016) - Moral arguments for God follow

1. There are objective moral facts
   1. Challenge: Subjectivist and expressivist theories
2. God provides the best explanation of the existence of these facts
   1. Challenge: Not everyone agrees here
3. Therefore, God probably exists



### I. Theoretical Moral Arguments

*"Although it is worth noting that no single metaethical theory seems to enjoy widespread support among philosophers, so a DCT is not alone in being a minority view."*

We have moral laws and we have political laws. Our political laws come from our government authority figures, it makes sense that our moral laws would come from an authority figure as well.

Alvin Plantinga - Even if you are not aware of moral laws, you can still have a moral experience. This person would not need to understand the arguments for God in order to have a reasonable belief in God. Moral arguments could still help this person understand and defend their beliefs.

Robert Adams - Why do we feel moral obligations if there is no God / objective moral standards? "An obligation has a special kind of force; we should care about complying with it, and violations of obligations appropriately incur blame". Not all social obligations are moral obligations. “A genuinely moral conception of obligation must have resources for moral criticism of social systems and their demands.”

1. There are objective moral obligations.
2. God provides the best explanation of the existence of moral obligations.
3. Probably, God exists.



### II. Arguments from Moral Knowledge of Awareness









## Reason for God (Book)

**The Clues of God**

*Intro*

 A brilliant young scientist looks at many arguments for God. He felt that every one had some evidence was rationally avoidable in some way. 

Author response - You are assuming "strong rationalism", but Chrisitianity requires faith. Also, instead of trying to find airtight "proof", look at the evidence cumulatively as a clue for the existence of God.

My issue: A collection of weak arguments is not the same as a strong one.

1. The Mysterious Bang

Note: He is not providing evidence for Christianity. He is starting from a place of Christianity as the default, posing potential atheist arguments, and then trying to cast a shadow of doubt on them.



Francis Collins

- 15B years ago was the first time we had "something". 

- This implies that, before this, there was "nothing". 

- This implies that someone "started" the universe. Otherwise, how could the universe create itself from nothing?

  I don't have an answer to this but I feel like there probably is one.



Author

- Everything we know in this world is contingent on other things outside of itself.

- The universe is a collection of such contingent entities.

- Therefore, the universe must be contingent on something else.

  He's placing the same restrictions on the universe itself as we have for things that are inside the universe. He's drawing equalivants that exist in the words but don't necessarily exist in nature.



2. Cosmic Welcome Mat

- The probability of the physics stuff coming together in the way it did is statistically negligible. There are 15 constants required - any of them being off by 1/millionth, our universe would not have occured

- Therefore, its more likely that there was someone who "fine-tuned" things. Additionally, does it really make sense based on if the tiny chance is actually true?

  - Stephen Hawking agrees

  My issue: He's making it seem like its either Christianity or atheism, and atheisms odds are tied to the tiny number.



3. Regularity of Nature

- We have no justification for believing that the future has been like the past. We must just take it on faith. And isn't that what Christians do anyway?

  - Author says that many scholars think modern science came from Christian civilizations - God sustains an orderly universe

  My issue: Not fully understanding something is not a good enough reason to believe in God. Lack of answers does not indicate that there is a God, just that humans haven't figured it out / aren't capable of understanding.



4. The Clue of Beauty

- If there is no God, then everything in the world is just a combination of atoms and there is no purpose to anything. This includes beauty and love.

- In contrast, we feel and long and things like love.

  - The appetite for food proves that food exists.
  - Then, the longing for meaning suggests that there is meaning.

  My issue: Being able to imagine something does not imply that it exists.



5. The Clue Killer

- Everything about us as humans is a by-product of natural selection. This includes our ability to use reason. 
- However, natural selection would lead our reasoning to be whatever helps us survive. It does not lead to actually uncovering the truth.
- If the brains of atheists can't be trusted to capture reality, why should we listen to them at all?



6. The Clue-Killer is Really a Clue

- If there is no God, than you would not expect to see things like love / beauty. You also wouldn't trust your brain, or that the sun will rise tomorrow.
- In contrast, we do. The world that we would expect to see from the Big Bang differs from what we do actually see.

Neanderthals disappeared mysteriously around 30k years ago.

Could the "great flood" have been a plate techtonic shift?

We know that there was some interbreeding between neanderthals and humans. Could Noah and his family have been those people? 

Shorter, stockier, angled cheekbones, prominent brow ridges, wide noses

[Link](https://web.csulb.edu/~mbiedeba/ch10.html) - Larger brains, but smaller cerebellum (movement, balance and vision to learning, language and mood)

What this suggests, researchers say, is that Neanderthals seem to have been less cognitively flexible, and worse at thinking on their feet, learning and adapting to change than *Homo sapiens*. They may have had language—it’s still up for debate—but their linguistic processing abilities would have been a fraction of modern humans’. Add to that shorter attention spans, and worse short- and long-term memories, and a picture begins to emerge about how these early people might have struggled to adapt in comparison.



[Link](https://answersingenesis.org/human-evolution/neanderthal/those-enigmatic-neanderthals/) - Cuozzo and Lubenow - Currently, the most widely accepted creationist view of the Neanderthals is that they were very early nomadic humans, probably one of the tribes that departed from Babel in the dispersion (for example, Oard 2003b, Robertson and Sarfati 2003). 

Cuozzo (1998) - (Mostly ignored by Creationists) - Neanderthals were ancient people who had developed their unique appearance because they lived to an age of several hundred years, and, in addition, they had matured to adulthood very slowly.

Lubenow (2004) - Their unique skull characteristics were possibly the result of family genetic traits and/or poor diet and lack of sunshine during the Ice Age, or perhaps disease.





Homo erectus

- Homo sapiens (Africa)
- Neanderthals (Europe)
- Denisovans (Asia and Australia)







- In this context, it was reported in 2010 that two-thirds of the entire Neanderthal genome has been sequenced from three female Neanderthals (who reportedly lived in Croatia from 38,000 to 44,000 years ago). 
- Noah's Ark - 8k to 13k bc
- 5k bc - There was a great flood in the Black Sea region
- The world - Genesis 2:10-14
  - Flood - Mesopotamia (ie Iraq) all the way to Egypt and Ethiopia (Basically the middle east)
  - Who lived lives much longer than we do, and who were far physically superior to we modern human beings. Their eyesight was incredible, too, enabling them to make carvings in pitch dark caves without apparent use of light.





## New Testament

Gospel means "good news" - story of Jesus

### Gospels

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaucATa9ufQ)

Each were put together their own theological points. Purpose was not to give a historical perspective.



**Matthew** - Close follower of Jesus

- Jesus = King of the Jews
- Emphasize teachings of Jesus, how his teachings intersect with Old Testament
- Jesus fulfills word of the Law + Prophets















---

**Mark** - Was not a close follower of Jesus, took notes from Peter

- Jesus = Suffers on behalf of us
- Emphasis on Jesus authority and being son of God
- Likely a source for Matthew and Luke



**Luke** - Gentile, wrote to put together a biography for his friend

- Jesus = Savior of all people
- Events are in chronological order
- Acts is the sequal to Luke



**John** - material is unique, won't be found in other parts of the New Testament

- Jesus = God
- Focuses on miracles and significant statements that Jesus made
- Meant to persuade non-believers









## Christianity - the 1st 3000 years

1054 - Split between Western Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church

Jesus drew from teachings of Greece and Israel



### Ch 1 - Greece and Rome



#### Greek Beginnings (pg 20)

Greeks - 800bc to 146bc [link](https://www.timemaps.com/civilizations/ancient-greeks/)

Romans - 753bc to 476ad [link](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-rome/ancient-rome)

650bc - First tyrannos in Greek (Corinth)

1200 bce - Sudden catastrophe in the Mycenae / Eastern Mediterranean

510 bc - First democracy (Athens)

There was much struggle in getting Jewish past convert over to Greek

Word = logos = thought behind the speech

Jesus is the Greek word for Joshua / Yeshua

"Christos" was added by his followers after dying on the cross

Jesus' hometown was Nazareth (Jewish city)

Greeks destroyed non-Greek city of Troy (Today is Turkey)

Greeks considered all non-Greeks as below them, but were interested in Persian Empire (Iran) and Egyptian Empire

Greeks began Olympics to honor Zeus

Jews and Greeks both borrowed method of writing (alphabet) from Phoenicians

Alpha and Omega are the 1st and last letters of the Greek alphabet

Greeks had so many city-states (polis) because they lived in a very rocky area - hard to keep everyone together in one place

Aristotle - living in an actual city evelates one over barbarians

Church = Greek for assembly of citizens in the polis to make decisions

Ekklesia = the polis of God (community)      |       Kirk = belonging to the Lord (authority)

Greeks did not appeal to higher authority when overthrowing govt, structured justice on their own



SPA

- 469 - 399 bce - Socrates

- 428 - 348 bce - Plato

  - Forms
  - Ethics - God should be ethical, not like the pantheon of Greek gods

- 384 - 322 bce - Aristotle

  - Plato was more of an "idealist", Aristotle would look of the data of what actually happens. 

    

499 bce - 450bce (roughly) - Athens vs Persians (during life of Socrates )

- Athens go to war with Persian Empire and win

- Hereodotos writes a book about it - gave the entire truth, not just the parts that could be shared with children to learn about morals



431 - 404bce - "Pelpopennesian War"

- After Athens beat the Persians, they had a ton of self confidence & wealth and decided to take over a league of Greek city-states. This made the Spartans jealous so Spartans attacked and won
- Thucydides (an Athens general) writes about how the collective corruption of their own society had led to their downfall

---



#### Hellenstic Greece



340bce 

- (Macedonian) Alexander the Great's dad takes over Greece
- Alexander the Great takes over from his father
- Combination of Greek and Macedonian take over tons of area to the east and set up local imitations of Greek culture
- Leaders abandoned democracy, became dictators / monarchs
- Philosophy wasn't able to influence leaders anymore, so it became more of an "inward" reflection
  - Label of Cynic from memory of Diogenes
  - Pyrrhon - its best to keep from making any judgements at all
  - Epicurus - Life's ultimate goal is the pursuit of happiness
  - Zeno - taught Stoics to conquer their passions, don't let life get you down
