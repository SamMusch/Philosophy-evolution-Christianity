## Free will

Decisions - Momentary actions of intention formation, responses to uncertainity of action

Intentions 

- Can be either proximal or distal
- Can be conditional



Libet Experiment

- Your brain makes a decision to act
- Your consciousness becomes aware of it
- Your consciousness lets us step in before we act.

So is the brain wave the cause? Or is it the "how" of our decision?

Evolutionary memories of such importance were coded into the 

- genome in rough form (as primary brain processes)
- these are refined by basic learning mechanisms (secondary processes) as well as by 
- higher-order cognitions/thoughts (tertiary processes)



Neural nature of of emotions

- Overactive panic/grief networks
- Diminished seeking networks



Levels of control 

1. Primary processes (sub-neocortical)
   1. Emotional affects
   2. Homeostatic affects
   3. Sensory affects
2. Secondary processes (basal ganglia)
   1. Classical conditioning
   2. Instrumental and operant conditioning
   3. Emotional habits
3. Third - Neocortical "awareness" function (cerebral cortex)
   1. Cognitive executive functions: thoughts and planning
   2. Emotional deep thoughts
   3. Free will







## Dualism (philosophy of mind)

[Standford](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/)

Materialism = all facts are causally dependent upon physical processes

- Including facts about the human mind & will & human history

"Default" option is materialism and monoism

- the mind and body are not separate



Dualism = theory that mind and body are different things

Ontology = nature of being



### Mind body problem

What is the relationship between mental properties and physical properties?

Humans have

- physical properties
- mental properties (consciousness, perceptual experience)
- intentionality (beliefs, desires)



Mind body problem breaks down into

1. Ontological question
   1. what are mental states? what are physical states? are they distinct, or does one depend on the other?
2. Causal question
   1. do physical states influence mental states? Do mental states influence physical states? If so, how?
3. The problem of consciousness: 
   1. what is consciousness? How is it related to the brain and the body?
4. The problem of intentionality: 
   1. what is intentionality? How is it related to the brain and the body?
5. The problem of the self: 
   1. what is the self? How is it related to the brain and the body?
6. The problem of embodiment: 
   1. what is it for the mind to be housed in a body? What is it for a body to belong to a particular subject?



#### Resulting Theories

Materialism = Mental states are just physical states

- Behaviourism, functionalism, mind-brain identity theory
- Our mental states can modify our behavior

Idealism = physical states are actually just mental states

- physical world is an emirical (observed) world
- product of our collective experience

Dualism = mental and physical are distinct and both are real
